# WeInvest Analysis for Spring 2025
This is the formal analysis of data collected by 12 cohort members within the WeInvest cohort at the Women's Interdisciplinary Society of Entrepreneurship. 

WeInvest is a series of experiential, educational workshops focusing on the foundations of venture capital taught by industry professionals. All members accepted into this cohort, of a 15% acceptance rate, had a low to no basis of understanding of VC, and were selected due to their passion and excitement to learn within the field. 

A standard survey of 15 questions was administered at the beginning of the cohort (1st class out of 6) and resurveyed after the last class.
